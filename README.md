# Sentiment Analysis Web App
This is a simple web application built with Streamlit, TextBlob, and Pandas that allows users to perform sentiment analysis on input text and CSV files. The app categorizes text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on its sentiment polarity score. Additionally, it provides a text-cleaning feature for preprocessing input text.
# Features
# Sentiment Analysis of Text:
Enter any text, and the app will analyze its sentiment.
The sentiment is categorized into Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on polarity scores.
# Text Cleaning:
Clean your input text to remove unwanted characters and formatting using the cleantext library.
# Sentiment Analysis of CSV Files:
Upload a CSV file containing a "text" column. The app will analyze the sentiment of each row and display the results in the form of a new column ("Sentiment").
It visualizes the sentiment distribution of the text data in the CSV using a bar chart.
# Technologies Used
Streamlit: For creating interactive web apps.
TextBlob: For performing sentiment analysis.
Pandas: For data handling and processing.
CleanText: For cleaning the input text.
Matplotlib: For plotting the sentiment distribution.
# How to Use
